### info

The `hay_aeon_exclusions.js` file creates a global variable which is used by embedded hay-aeon javascript in [classic-josiah](https://github.com/birkin/hay_aeon_classic_js/blob/master/hay_aeon_classic.js) and [new-josiah](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/bul-search/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/application.js).

The purpose is to prevent a hay-aeon link from appearing on certain marc location strings.
